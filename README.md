# Information-Retrieval-Page-Rank-Assignment_Python
In this assignment, I have implemented the page rank algorithm in Python and tested it against a huge data set and shared the results.

For further details and the problem statement, please refer to "assignment+3+Page+Rank.pdf" - NOTE: SKIP QUESTION 1, THIS ASSIGNMENT IS BASED ON QUESTION 2

You can find the in-links file mentioned in Task 2 of the problem statement as "wt2g_inlinks" (the collection against which the page rank algorithm is tested)

There are two versions of code against Task2; one is the longer version and other is the shorter version. There isn't much difference between the two, except that the shorter version is much cleaner and contains fewer comments. If you want a better understanding of the code, you can examine the longer version first.

The code was executed and tested in Python 3.6.4
